        What are DIMO Credits (DCX)?

      <p className="description-content">
        DCX is a stablecoin thatâ€™s pegged to one-tenth of a cent (0.001 USD),
        and is essential for all developers building on DIMO. For DIMO protocol
        fees, spending DCX or $DIMO is required. The only way to get DCX is by
        trading in $DIMO, which converts at the market price. This provides
        developers a way to lock-in DCX at a rate without being influenced by
        price fluctuation. DCX cannot be converted back into $DIMO and when it
        is spent, it is burned forever. For more details on DCX, check out{' '}
