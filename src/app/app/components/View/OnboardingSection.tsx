            <p>
                DCX is a stablecoin thatâ€™s pegged to one-tenth of a cent (0.001 USD), and is essential for all developers building on DIMO.
                For DIMO protocol fees, spending DCX or $DIMO is required. The only way to get DCX is by trading in $DIMO, which converts at the market price.
                This provides developers a way to lock in DCX at rates without being influenced by price fluctuation.
                DCX cannot be converted back into $DIMO and when it is spent, it is burned forever.
                For more details on DCX, check out our explanation on DCX & $DIMO.
